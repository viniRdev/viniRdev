### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my  GitHub repository! This is where I experiment and test out new ideas and approaches to programming and web development for my youtube channel.

Please note that this is a testing account, and the code found here may not always be complete or fully functional. If you're looking for the complete, polished code that I use in my YouTube tutorials, you can find it on my youtube channel [VinÃ­cius Rodrigues](https://www.youtube.com/@viniscode), or check my primary github account [ViniSCode](https://www.github.com/viniscode)

However, if you're interested in following along with my experiments and testing, then this repository is the perfect place for you.

Thank you for visiting viniRdev's GitHub repository!
